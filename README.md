_Incremental Development_ is a strategy for developing software. In this strategy you start with the simplest code you can possibly write to get things started. Often this is just empty files with the right names, in the right folders! Then in small steps you add more code so that each little step _works_, builds on top of the last step, and is a little closer to the end goal.

This strategy is sooooo important to learn because **programming is hard**. All developers (even your coaches!) make mistakes all the time. The best way to manage mistakes is to work in small, understandable steps and making sure that each step works before moving on.

Incremental Development is more about discipline than talent. Every minute you spend practicing this now will save you hours of debugging and make collaboration a breeze!

## Module Projects

Projects in Incremental Development are all about the workflows. Take plenty of time to familiarize yourself with [Planning and Collaborating](./planning-and-collaborating), practicing these steps is your main objective for the coming 3 weeks.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

In the first weeks it's likely that you'll spend as much time figuring out how to plan and work with Git/GitHub as you will spend writing code. _This is totally normal and OK!_ Working like a developer takes time and practice to get good at, and at this point in your learning it's even more important than mastering HTML & CSS!

So on days when you find yourself spending a couple hours struggling with branches, trying to push your homework or create an issue, remind yourself that it's all time well spent. Mastering these skills _now_ will free your time _later_ to focus on studying the more interesting and challenging skills in this course.

Developing a working web site is not enough! You will be expected to submit a development strategy and complete repository, cleanly developed with one branch per step. The goal of these projects is to practice planning and building clean projects in a structured way. The goal of these projects _is not_ to build the fanciest most beautiful website, to use all the latest CSS tricks, or to use cool libraries.

Here's a short list of do's and don'ts that can help you stay on track:

### Do

- ... ask for help early and often
- ... pay as much attention to your branches & repository as your code
- ... be very careful about your CSS classes, selectors and id's
- ... properly format your code
- ... find the simplest solution to each task in your projects

### Don't

- ... think that your site can be pretty enough to make up for messy code
- ... make any steps of your project do less _or more_ than is described in the strategy
- ... move on to the next step before the previous one is finished

## Week 1

This week will be a crash-course on how to plan, organize, and develop a software project. You will work in groups to reverse-engineer a website, with finished code as a starting point.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

[Planning and Collaborating](./planning-and-collaborating): This is important, take your time to understand it!

### During Class

In class you will get to know your coaches, discuss the Planning and Collaborating process, then get a start on this week's group project.

#### Before Break

1. Introductions from each coach
2. Q/A time about the secret lives of developers
3. A walk-through and discussion of [Planning and Collaborating](./planning-and-collaborating)

#### After Break

1. As a full class, take a look through the finished [loruki-website](./loruki-website) code and discuss how it might be broken into small tasks
2. Break into small groups and get set up for this week's group project. You should aim to have created your group's repository by the end of class.

### After Class

> group project

This week's project is to study the [**loruki-website** tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website) from Traversy Media. A working website is not enough! You are expected to create a group repository named `loruki-website`, as described in Planning and Collaborating. Your group is not expected to submit exactly the same code as Mr. Traversy. You are free to add features, remove features, or write your features differently than he did. His tutorial code is just a starting point.

This is a large project to finish in one week, it's ok if you don't finish all the code! What's most important is that you get used to the Planning and Collaborating workflows.

In the tutorial, Mr. Traversy deployes his website using Netlify. For your group project you can use GitHub Pages instead.

Here's a good way to approach the group project:

1. Before watching the tutorial video (aim to have this finished on Tuesday):
   - **Backlog**: Study the finished website as a group to come up with your backlog and priorities. You won't need to look at the actual code for this step, backlogs are all about what the user sees!
   - **Development Strategy**: Study the finished code as a group. What code did Mr. Traversy write for each step? how would you break that code into different tasks?
   - **Project Board**: Convert your Development Strategy into issues and a project board in your group repo.
2. While studying the tutorial individually, each group member can assign themselves tasks from the project board to practice the HTML & CSS they are learning in the tutorial.
3. After everyone has finished studying the tutorial you can already organize a group call to discuss what you learned and write your **Retrospective**. Your group does not need to have finished the project before doing the Retrospective.

### Issue Checklist

Copy-paste this checklist into a new project issue and move your issue to the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `project`, `week-1`
- milestone: `incremental-development`

```md
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_) (GitHub Pages, not Netlify)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```

## Week 2

You're on your own! This week you will start a 2-week project where your group needs to reverse-engineer a live website, without starter code.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

You and your group should come prepared to present your Retrospective. Each group will have ~5 minutes to share how the project went last week. Keep it short and clear!

Besides the Retrospectives, this Sunday will be all review and preparation for the week's project. Come ready with all sorts of questions!

### During Class

#### Before Break

1. Questions & review
2. Retrospective presentations, ~5 minutes per group
3. Coach-led discussion of challenges and Lessons Learned

#### After Break

1. Read over the hackyourfuture.be website as a full class
   - how would you break this into small steps?
   - which pieces are most important?
2. Break into small groups and prepare your repository for the group project

### After Class

> group project

Your group will have 2 weeks to reverse-engineer as much of hackyourfuture.be as possible. You're on your own! Starting with an empty repository your group will need to define a backlog with priorities, create a project board full of tasks, and get coding!

Pay special attention to:

- Using HTML5 Semantic Element
- Accessibility
- Responsive Design

### Issue Checklist

Copy-paste this checklist into a new project issue and move your issue to the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `project`, `week-2`, `week-3`
- milestone: `incremental-development`

```md
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_) (GitHub Pages, not Netlify)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
- [ ] no JavaScript!
```

## Week 3

No new material, one more week to practice planning and collaborating before learning about UX/UI Design.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Before Class

> Do you have any questions from last week? Add the `question` label to an issue in your class repo so your coaches know what to review!

Nothing new! Come ready to discuss your group's work last week, and to share tips for a better next week.

### During Class

#### Before Break

1. Questions & review
2. ~5 minute status report from each group
3. Coach-led discussion of challenges and Lessons Learned

#### After Break

Prepare for the week! Break into groups and meet with a coach to discuss your progress from last week, and to make plans for a success week ahead.

### After Class

> group project

Finish building as much of hackyourfuture.be as possible before Friday. On Friday or Saturday your group should gather to discuss how the project went and to fill out your Retrospective.

You can move your group issue into "Ready for Review" after you have finished your Retrospective. Just like the first week's project, you will be assessed on your planning and collaborating not on a finished project.
